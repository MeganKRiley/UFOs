## Overview
This project allows users to easily browse through a database of UFO sightings using a variety of filters to easily narrow down the search from any web browser.

The UFO sighting and filtering section of the website is located on the bottom half of the home page.  When you first navigate to it, you'll see all sightings listed, as well as the filtering options, which currently hold example text.  Users can fill out as many or as few filtering options as they'd like to narrow down their search.  All filtering text should be written in lower case lettering. Users can either click the "enter" button or simply click outside of the filter search section to execute their search.  Only sightings that meet all entered criteria will now populate.

## Summary
### Drawback
One major drawback to this site is the limitations of the search fields.  Someone would need to know a lot of very exact information to locate certain sightings.  For instance, someone might want to look up a specific sighting but they only remember that it occured in the late 1990's and in a less populated state.  Unfortunately, none of this information would help narrow the search.  Users would need an exact date and state to execute this search.  

### Recommendations
I would recommend a few additions to the site to make it even more functional for users.  I'd like to add features that allow more wiggle room in the text field as well as a date range rather than just selecting a single date.  The improved text field features would allow the use of mixed cases, spaces, and close matches.  The date range feature would allow users to be more broad if they're looking for a specific sighting without knowing the exact date, or if they were intentially looking for a range to further search for trends.
